This is a repo of a simple implementation of raytracing that can be done in one weekeend following the book of Peter Shirley. 
The code was originally written in C++,but for this implementation Rust will be used to learn the language and to see how it compares to C++ in terms of performance and ease of use.

The code is not optimized and is not meant to be used in production, it is just a learning project and purely for fun!
The code is based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.
The book can be found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

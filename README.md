# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Rust Implementation

A Rust implementation of Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book. This project translates the original C++ code to Rust to explore language differences and learning opportunities.

## About

This is a learning project that implements a basic ray tracer in Rust. The implementation follows Peter Shirley's book while exploring Rust's unique features and comparing them with C++.
Ironically named,this project will not be fully implemented in one weekend due to Skill Issue by me.
I also use the aid of copilot to assist me in navigating through rust!

## Project Goals

- Learn Rust programming concepts
- Compare Rust and C++ implementations
- Understand basic ray tracing principles
- Explore Rust's performance characteristics

## Original Source

This implementation is based on:
- Book: "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley
- Original Link: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## Disclaimer

This code is meant for learning purposes and is not optimized for production use.

## Build and Run

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

```This is a repo of a simple implementation of raytracing that can be done in one weekeend following the book of Peter Shirley. 
The code was originally written in C++,but for this implementation Rust will be used to learn the language and to see how it compares to C++ in terms of performance and ease of use.

The code is not optimized and is not meant to be used in production, it is just a learning project and purely for fun!
The code is based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.
The book can be found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
